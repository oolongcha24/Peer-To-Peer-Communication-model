# Peer-To-Peer-Communication-model
A peer-to-peer communication model that allows peers to upload and download files from another peer

This Peer-to-Peer (P2P) application enables users to share and download files. It consists of an index server and multiple peers (users). Each peer can act as both a content server and a client. The application involves registering content with the index server, which then facilitates the process of other peers finding and downloading this content. It uses UDP and TCP protocols for communication and content transfer, ensuring efficient and reliable data exchange.
